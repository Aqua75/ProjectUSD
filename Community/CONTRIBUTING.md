# Contributing to ProjectUSD

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **ProjectUSD**,  
an open and autonomous monetary framework designed for PulseChain.  
Every improvement, translation, diagram, and line of code helps bring this vision closer to reality.

## **1. Core Philosophy**

ProjectUSD is not a company, token sale, or commercial product.  
It is a community-driven blueprint — a mathematical design for self-regulating digital money.

> 🌀 *"When the code cannot lie, humanity no longer needs to."*

All contributions must respect the system’s core principles:

- **Decentralization:** no central authority or privileged control  
- **Transparency:** everything must be verifiable on-chain or in open documentation  
- **Immutability:** the core code is final once the Freeze Event occurs  
- **Integrity:** accuracy, honesty, and reproducibility above all else  

---

## **2. Ways to Contribute**

There are many ways to support ProjectUSD:

### 🧩 **Development**
- Implement smart-contract modules (Vaults, Controller, Stability Pool, AMO, etc.)  
- Write tests, simulations, or audits  
- Improve security tooling or performance  

See [`Docs/Developer_Guidelines.md`](../Docs/Developer_Guidelines.md) for full details.

### 🧠 **Research**
- Model the control system (relationships between `r`, `R`, and `P`)  
- Analyze stability scenarios and risk parameters  
- Propose improvements to algorithmic feedback loops

### 🌐 **Translations**
All official translations of the ProjectUSD Whitepaper are created and maintained by the original author.  
The translated editions are published in the `/Whitepaper/` directory using the following naming format:

ProjectUSD_Whitepaper_V2.1_<LanguageCode>_<LanguageName>.pdf

For example:

ProjectUSD_Whitepaper_V2.1_FR_Francais.pdf

ProjectUSD_Whitepaper_V2.1_TR_Turkish.pdf

ProjectUSD_Whitepaper_V2.1_KR_Korean.pdf

ProjectUSD_Whitepaper_V2.1_ID_Indonesian.pdf

Community members who wish to assist (for example with proofreading or layout formatting)  
can contact the author through the official ProjectUSD Telegram discussion group.
