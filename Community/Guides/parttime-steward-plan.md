# Part-Time Steward Plan  
### A structured framework for long-term community contribution

ProjectUSD stewards are community members who take recurring responsibility  
for maintaining, improving, or supporting key areas of the ecosystem —  
on a flexible, part-time basis.

This document defines the expectations, responsibilities, and workflow  
for becoming a ProjectUSD Part-Time Steward.

## 🎯 Steward Mission

Stewards help ensure that:

- documentation stays accurate and high-quality  
- newcomers receive guidance  
- misinformation is corrected quickly  
- discussions remain productive  
- research and outreach move forward  
- the community acts professionally and consistently  

Stewards do **not** control the protocol.  
They support the **ecosystem**, not the **immutability**.

## 🧩 Steward Responsibilities

Depending on skills and interest, stewards may work in:

### **1. Documentation Maintenance**
- fixing inconsistencies  
- updating references  
- improving clarity  
- reporting missing areas  

### **2. Research & Analysis**
- reviewing stablecoin models  
- summarizing risk factors  
- providing insights into market behavior  

### **3. Community Support**
- answering questions politely  
- pointing users to correct resources  
- maintaining a welcoming, factual atmosphere  

### **4. Outreach & Education**
- creating visual explanations  
- summarizing concepts  
- producing small guides or charts  

### **5. Monitoring & Reporting**
- identifying repeated misunderstandings  
- reporting unclear documentation  
- helping refine communication  

A steward chooses their focus — there is no fixed assignment.

## ⏱ Time Commitment

Part-time stewards contribute:

- **2–6 hours per week**, depending on availability  
- flexible timing  
- no deadlines  
- no obligation when unavailable  

Consistency matters more than volume.

## 🔄 Steward Workflow

1. **Pick a focus area** based on your strengths  
2. **Start small** (one fix, one answer, one summary)  
3. **Share your work** in the group for visibility  
4. **Iterate** based on feedback  
5. **Document what you’ve done** (short weekly note is enough)  

This creates a positive feedback loop of meaningful contributions.

## 🌱 Growth Path

Long-term stewards can grow into:

- documentation maintainers  
- research coordinators  
- onboarding specialists  
- community educators  
- project ambassadors  

No hierarchy — only responsibility and trust.

## ❤️ Appreciation

Stewards strengthen the ecosystem by being reliable, constructive,  
and professional.

Your leadership — even part-time — helps ProjectUSD grow  
into the most transparent and resilient monetary system on PulseChain.

Thank you for your service.
