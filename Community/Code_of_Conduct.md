# Code of Conduct – ProjectUSD Community

---

## **1. Purpose**

ProjectUSD exists to build an open, autonomous, and incorruptible monetary system.  
To achieve this, we must also embody the same values that define our code:  
**clarity, transparency, respect, and logic.**

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces — including GitHub discussions, Telegram groups, and any related channels.

---

## **2. Our Principles**

We are guided by the same philosophy that governs the protocol itself:

> 🌀 *"When the code cannot lie, humanity no longer needs to."*

- **Integrity:** Speak truthfully, contribute honestly, and document transparently.  
- **Respect:** Debate ideas, not individuals.  
- **Rationality:** Argue with data and reason, not emotion or speculation.  
- **Equality:** Every participant’s contribution is valued regardless of background or experience.  
- **Autonomy:** No one owns ProjectUSD; it belongs to everyone who contributes in good faith.

---

## **3. Expected Behavior**

All participants are expected to:

- Use clear and constructive language.  
- Provide factual information when making claims or suggestions.  
- Offer feedback that improves, rather than discourages, contributions.  
- Help newcomers understand the principles behind ProjectUSD.  
- Keep discussions focused on ideas, architecture, and verified facts.  
- Assume good intent — misunderstandings are natural in decentralized communication.  

---

## **4. Unacceptable Behavior**

To maintain a productive environment, the following will not be tolerated:

- Personal attacks, insults, or harassment  
- Hate speech or discriminatory remarks of any kind  
- Promotion of scams, token sales, or unrelated projects  
- Repeated posting of misinformation or off-topic content  
- Deliberate disruption of technical discussions  
- Doxxing or revealing private information  

Violations may result in warnings, muted access, or removal from contributor channels and groups.

---

## **5. Conflict Resolution**

If disagreements arise:

1. Seek private clarification first — often a misunderstanding can be resolved directly.  
2. If the issue persists, involve another respected community member or moderator.  
3. Always prioritize transparency and logic over emotion or hierarchy.  

Remember: **disagreement is natural — disrespect is optional.**

---

## **6. Representing ProjectUSD**

If you post about ProjectUSD on social media, forums, or other platforms:

- Speak as an individual, not as an official representative.  
- Avoid making promises, financial claims, or unverified statements.  
- Link to official sources (GitHub, Whitepaper, or Documentation) for reference.  
- Uphold the same tone of professionalism and clarity that defines the project.  

---

## **7. Scope and Enforcement**

This Code applies to all ProjectUSD-related activities:  
- GitHub commits, comments, and issues  
- Telegram or chat discussions  
- Live calls or community meetings  
- Third-party collaborations under the ProjectUSD name  

Moderators or repository maintainers may take action if conduct breaches these principles.  
Actions can include content removal, temporary restrictions, or, in severe cases, permanent exclusion.

---

## **8. Continuous Improvement**

As the project evolves, so will our conduct standards.  
Suggestions for improvement to this Code can be made via Pull Request to:  

All revisions must preserve the spirit of open collaboration and mutual respect.

---

## **9. Closing Statement**

ProjectUSD is more than code — it is a collective pursuit of truth through logic.  
To keep it pure, we must treat each other with the same precision and fairness  
that we demand from the protocol itself.

> 🧩 *Code is law — and respect is the social contract.*
