# Roadmap – Path to Autonomy

ProjectUSD is not a token launch but an infrastructure vision — a stable monetary framework designed to evolve into a self-regulating organism on PulseChain.  
The rollout must proceed gradually, with each stage proving that the system remains stable without external intervention.

---

## **Phase 1 – Guarded Launch**
The beginning is intentionally small.  
Strict limits apply during this testing phase:
- Low maximum debt ceiling  
- No active PSM or AMO modules  
- Intensive on-chain monitoring of all metrics  

**Goal:**  
To observe how effectively the Controller reacts to price deviations,  
how the Stability Pool absorbs stress,  
and how quickly the market price converges toward the equilibrium price **R**.  

All data remains public – an open laboratory on PulseChain.  
Only once sustained stability is proven, Phase 2 begins.

---

## **Phase 2 – Parameter Freeze & Proof of Stability**
When the equilibrium proves reliable — with small peg deviations, efficient liquidations, and healthy collateral ratios —  
the core parameters are **frozen**.

This includes:
- Collateral Ratio  
- Liquidation Threshold  
- Controller logic and Redemption mechanism  

Once frozen, the **core becomes immutable**, turning ProjectUSD from an experiment into a living organism.  
From this moment, no governance vote or developer update can change it.  
**Code becomes law – and remains so.**

---

## **Phase 3 – Peg Stability Module (PSM light)**
After the successful Freeze Event, an optional PSM basket may be activated.  
This on-chain basket contains other stablecoins to dampen short-term market friction.

Strict limits apply:
- Daily swap limit per slot (e.g., 1% of total supply)  
- Small haircut fee per swap (0.1–0.5%)  
- Full on-chain transparency and logging  

The PSM does not “support” the peg; it merely **softens volatility**.  
Even if the PSM fails, ProjectUSD continues to function independently.

---

## **Phase 4 – Algorithmic Market Operations (AMO on)**
Once long-term stability is demonstrated, controlled **AMO modules** can be activated.  
They operate within tight price ranges to:
- Provide liquidity  
- Perform arbitrage within defined spreads  
- Optimize the Surplus Buffer  

Every AMO has a fixed budget and must remain fully auditable.  
This allows ProjectUSD to expand organically into DeFi markets without relying on centralized interventions.

---

## **Phase 5 – Integration into the PulseChain Ecosystem**
After ProjectUSD has proven itself as a stable value anchor, it begins to integrate into the wider ecosystem:

- **DEX pairs:** ProjectUSD/PLS, ProjectUSD/PLSX, ProjectUSD/INC  
- **Lending protocols:** ProjectUSD as collateral and borrowable asset  
- **Derivatives & Perpetuals:** ProjectUSD as margin and settlement unit  
- **Payment gateways:** ProjectUSD as neutral accounting currency  

Each integration increases the network effect.  
The more protocols adopt ProjectUSD as standard money,  
the more independent PulseChain becomes from centralized stablecoins.

---

## **Phase 6 – Long-Term Evolution**
Once established, ProjectUSD continues to evolve organically:

- Addition of new native collateral types  
- Introduction of a long-term **Saving Rate (DSR)** derived from the Surplus Buffer  
- Decentralized AMO governance  
- Synergies with PulseX, LiquidLoans, and other ecosystem projects  

Ultimately, ProjectUSD can become the **unit of account for the entire PulseChain economy** —  
not as a dollar substitute, but as its own mathematically defined currency.

---

## **Philosophy – Code First, Hype Never**
Each phase only begins once the previous one has proven stable.  
Trust is earned through observation, not promises.  
The goal is not temporary TVL growth,  
but a permanent, functioning foundation for decentralized money.
