# Security Policy  
### Important Notice

This repository contains **specifications only**.  
There is **no software**, **no deployed code**, and **no implementation** in this project.

---

## 🔒 Reporting Security Concerns

Because no smart contracts exist in this repository:

- there are **no vulnerabilities** to report here  
- security issues apply **only to third-party implementations**  
- do not submit reports regarding external codebases  

If you believe you found a security issue in an independent implementation,  
please contact the maintainers of **that implementation**, not this repository.

---

## ⚠️ No Official Implementation

ProjectUSD does **not** publish or maintain smart contracts.  
All implementations are independent and must undergo:

- open-source review  
- independent audits  
- community verification

This repository plays **no role** in implementation-level security.
